## Overview

I attended the 79th Annual Meeting of the Society of Biological Psychiatry (SOBP) in Austin, Texas, in May 2024, where I delivered an oral presentation of my research titled "Neuropsychosocial Measures Linked to Problematic Gaming Cross-Sectionally and Longitudinally in Developing Youth." The experience was memorable, with a large audience attending my talk, for which I am very grateful. I also had the opportunity to connect with numerous researchers interested in studying pathological neuropsychological symptoms among youth, gaining valuable insights from our discussions.
