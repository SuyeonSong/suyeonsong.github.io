## Overview

I attended the 8th ICBA (International Conference on Behavioral Addictions) held in Incheon, Korea, in August 2023, and presented my research poster, titled "Unraveling Predictors of Problematic Gaming From the ABCD Study Using Machine Learning Approaches". This marked my second poster presentation at an international conference. The event provided a valuable platform for me to connect with esteemed researchers and gain insights from their presentations. I found many of the sessions inspiring and enriching, as they offered the latest and most critical information on the topic of pathological gaming.
