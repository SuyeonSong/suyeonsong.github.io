## Overview

I attended 2022 BIG-BRAIN seminar, held in Seoul National University Hoam Professors' Center. BIG-BRAIN stands for "**BIG** data **b**ased **R**obust and explainable **AI** **N**eural nets". Professors and researchers from Seoul National University, Korea University, KAIST, and Seoul National University Hospital attended the seminar and gave wonderful speeches on latest findings from their current research. It was a great opportunity for me to learn.
