## Overview

I attended 2022 BIG-BRAIN seminar which was held in Seoul National University Hoam Professors' Center. BIG-BRAIN stands for Big data based Robust and explainable AI Neural Nets. Professors and researchers from Seoul National University, Korea University, KAIST, and Seoul National University Hospital attended the seminar and gave wonderful speeches on latest findings from their current researches. It was a great opportunity for me to learn.
